📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting malaria incidence across Africa using machine learning and AI techniques. By analyzing historical malaria data, environmental factors, and socio-economic indicators, we aim to build a robust model that helps in early detection and intervention strategies.

# 📂  Dataset
The dataset contains malaria incidence records, climate data, and other relevant features across different African regions.
Data sources include WHO, national health reports, Open Data Africa
# 🛠️  Methodology
The project follows these steps:

*1* Data Collection & Preprocessing
*2* Cleaning missing values
*3* Feature selection and engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing malaria trends
Understanding correlations between variables
Model Training & Evaluation
Models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)
Performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
Deployment & Insights
